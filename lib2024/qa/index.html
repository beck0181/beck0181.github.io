	<ol>
		<!-- Question 1 -->
		<li>
			<p><strong>Question:</strong> What are the three components of Web?</p>
			<p><strong>Answer:</strong> HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</p>
		</li>
		<!-- Question 2 -->
		<li>
			<p><strong>Question:</strong> Define version control and give one example.</p>
			<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Version control is a system that records changes to something over time so that you can easily revert to an older version as needed. Usually done through software like GitHub.</p>
		</li>
		<!-- Question 3 -->
		<li>
			<p><strong>Question:</strong> What tag is used to create the title of a web page? Give an example</p>
			<p><strong>Answer: </strong>The title of a web page, if youâ€™re referring to the name of the page, is &lt;title&gt;, which is under the &lt;head&gt; parent.</p>
			<p>In terms of a heading, you use &lt;h#&gt; where the # is a number from 1 to 6 based on its importance; they are under the &lt;body&gt; parent.</p>
			<p>&lt;title&gt;This is an example of a title&lt;/title&gt;</p>
			<p>&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
		</li>
		<!-- Question 4 -->
		<li>
			<p><strong>Question:</strong> What tag is used to create a paragraph in html? Give an example.</p>
			<p><strong>Answer:</strong> In order to create a paragraph, the &lt;p&gt; tag is used.</p>
			<p>&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of a paragraph. As you can see, it is grammatically correct. Probably.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
		</li>
		<!-- Question 5 -->
		<li>
			<p><strong>Question: </strong>Identify the odd one from these tags: &lt;span&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;i&gt; and state the reason.</p>
			<p><strong>Answer: </strong>The odd one out is &lt;a&gt; which only deals with linking URLs, while the other three deal with content formatting.</p>
		</li>
		<!-- Question 6 -->
		<li>
			<p><strong>Question: </strong>What are the tags required to create a navigation list in HTML?</p>
			<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Primarily you need a &lt;nav&gt; tag</p>
		</li>
		<!-- Question 7 -->
		<li>
			<p><strong>Question: </strong>What element is used to create images? Name its attributes.</p>
			<p><strong>Answer: </strong>The element itself is &lt;img&gt;, and the attributes for it are src (which is the most important, as it's the URL of the image), alt, height, width, alt, longdesc, and ismap. There are other attributes, such as align and border, but they are not supported in HTML5</p>
		</li>
		<!-- Question 8 -->
		<li>
			<p><strong>Question:</strong> Identify the odd one from these tags: &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, &lt;td&gt;, and state the reason.</p>
			<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The odd one out is &lt;b&gt;. The other three are used for tables, while &lt;b&gt; is only used for <b>bold text</b></p>
		</li>
		<!-- Question 9 -->
		<li>
			<p><strong>Question: </strong>Give an example of color picker input.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Answer: </strong>The code looks like this: 
				<br>&lt;label for="co"&gt;This is a color picker example:&lt;label&gt;
				<br>&lt;input type="color" name="co" id="co"&gt;
			</p>
			<div id="st-container" class="form-elm">
				<label for="co">This is a color picker example:</label>
				<input type="color" name="co" id="co">
			</div>
		</li>
		<!-- Question 10 -->
		<li>
			<p><strong>Question: </strong>What is the use of name and value attributes? Give two examples</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Answer: </strong>name is exactly what it says on the tin: it's the name of an element, which is used for reference when JavaScript and CSS start getting added to the code.
				<br>value is similar, but provides a value for an element, and isn't used for reference, but for input purposes, or increment counting for &lt;li&gt; tags.
				<br>Examples:
				<br>&lt;input type="checkbox" name="places" id="france"&gt;
				<br>In this example, the name is "places," which can be used for other checkbox elements
				<br>&lt;li value="2"&gt;
				<br>In this example, if an &lt;ol&gt; is used in the &lt;li&gt; element, it will start with 2, because that's what the value is
			</p>
		</li>
		<!-- Question 11 -->
		<li>
			<p><strong>Question: </strong>Give an example of inline style</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Answer: </strong>&lt;h5 class="sub-head" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;This is an inline style example&lt;/h5&gt;
				<br>It would looks like this:
				<br><h5 class="sub-head" style="font-style: italic;">this is an inline style example</h5>
			</p>
		</li>
		<!-- Question 12 -->
		<li>
			<p><strong>Question: </strong>How would you link an external style sheet? Give example.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Answer: </strong>First you would create a style.css and have it within the same folder as the index.html. Then you would use an element that looks like this:
				<br>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"&gt;
				<br>The black background, and gold/white text are both the result of such a page, all of which is too much to show here.
