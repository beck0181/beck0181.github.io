    <main>
        <p>I am taking an incomplete on this assignment in protest of this course, because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>This course holds no relevance to our careers, and:</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The content we covered in this one course would've been done in a minimum of four in a web-development program.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I find it nonsensical to take this course "just in case I wanted to go into coding instead." If that was the course's purpose, it should've been offered as a general elective, and not a required course.</p>
        <p>As such, I am taking an incomplete, but still submitted, mark, and prioritizing my own mental health. Such is a best practice for life in general.</p>
