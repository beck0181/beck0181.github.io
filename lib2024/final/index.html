        <p>In protest of this course that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Serves no purpose to our careers</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Holds no relevance to our careers</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Is worthless to anyone who would want to switch to web development, thus ruining the purpose of it's presence</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Is poorly structured to the point that actual web designers are confused by it</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Essentially does sweet fuck all</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I have elected to refuse to do this final assignment, nor the in-class 3 assignment.</p>
        <p>Even with the zero I will earn on both, my grades are such that I still pass this course.</p>
        <p>tl;dr:</p>

        <p>Oh and by the way I've been taking scrupulous screenshots of my grades. So I'll know if you decide to break the law and retroactively change them. Toodles!</p>
